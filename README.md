# 03.05.2024 
- In the process of refactoring.

# 02.05.2024
- Added collision detection
- Added random spawn for obstacles.

**Next:**
- Refactor code. It's a mess.
- There's a bug with spawning where cars will spawn with strange shapes.

# 30.04.2024
- Small changes to the code: Obstacle Car movement, Check_positions and Clear Display.
- Car will disappear at the end of the map and reappear from the top. For now, in a loop.

# 26.04.2024
**Added:**
- Movement for Obstacle Cars.

# 25.04.2024
Currently the game has:
Level creation function - Creates an array of integers that gets translated in to the string for displaying.
Display and clear display functions - To show string as game "graphics" and to clear objects before they are redrawn on the screen.
Player movement functions.

Next:
Obstacle generation and movement.
Collision between objects.

I'm building this small game to practice C# alongside of working through Tutorials on WPF and ASP .NET from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/?view=vs-2022.
